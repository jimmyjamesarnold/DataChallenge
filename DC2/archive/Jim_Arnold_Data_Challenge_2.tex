\chapter{Executive summary:}\label{executive-summary}

Analysis of weekly user engagement suggests there is a cohort of 256
users, primarily located in North America and Europe, who have stopped
opening weekly digest emails. Given there remain active users in every
country, this is unlikely to be caused by regional server connectivity
issues.

Drop in user engagement does not appear to be isolated to a particular
kind of device, suggesting it's not likely a software/hardware issue.

It also appears to involve at least 1 user from every company, although
never 100\% from a given company, suggesting the drop in user engagement
is not likely due to changes in firewall / spam-filters.

Additionally, there is the weekly digest emails are being delivered as
expected, suggesting the drop in user engagement is not likely
product-related.

\subsection{It appears that while emails are being delivered as
expected, many users in North America and Europe are not engaging with
the product. Given this anomaly is occuring at the end of July / early
August, it may be possible we are seeing a seasonal effect, i.e. summer
vacation.}\label{it-appears-that-while-emails-are-being-delivered-as-expected-many-users-in-north-america-and-europe-are-not-engaging-with-the-product.-given-this-anomaly-is-occuring-at-the-end-of-july-early-august-it-may-be-possible-we-are-seeing-a-seasonal-effect-i.e.-summer-vacation.}

 \#\# The Problem - Investigating a Drop in User Engagement

Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks
over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity
on the user engagement dashboards. Here's what it looks like:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{attachment:image.png}
\caption{image.png}
\end{figure}

The above chart shows the number of engaged users each week.

Yammer defines engagement as having made some type of server call by
interacting with the product (shown in the data as events of type
``engagement'').

Any point in this chart can be interpreted as: \#\#\# ``the number of
users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting
on that date.''

Important to understand... 'enagagement' is defined in the
\textbf{\emph{events}} table.

\subsection{The head of product says ``Can you look into this and get me
a summary by this
afternoon?''}\label{the-head-of-product-says-can-you-look-into-this-and-get-me-a-summary-by-this-afternoon}

\subsection{"Sure thing!" I say.}\label{sure-thing-i-say.}

\chapter{But where to start?}\label{but-where-to-start}

 \# Hypotheses and Approach:

I believe I'm being asked to summarize the data and find a potential
explanation for the drop in 'active' users right around the end of July.
From the dashboard chart, it looks like around 200 people stopped
engaging, but this was after a period of growth.

200 users is pretty big. I think the best approach to summarizing this
data is trying to figure out what is common among the users who stopped
being 'active' around the end of July and August.

Given that 'active' is defined by 'engaging' with the product in some
way during the following week, I can think of a few possible hypotheses
to test.

\chapter{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

\subsection{1) Users were prompted to signup, then stopped using it. -
an adoption/ compliance

\subsection{To approach this question, I think it's important to explore
some details.
Specifically:}\label{to-approach-this-question-i-think-its-important-to-explore-some-details.-specifically}

\section{WHO stopped using the product? If time remaining, address
WHY.}\label{who-stopped-using-the-product-if-time-remaining-address-why.}

To answer the question of WHO, I'll need to look at the users who
specifically stopped engaging with the product between the end of July
and the end of August.

To assess this, I'll need to utilize user engagement with the platform,
which is in the events table. First thought - I'll try to group by a
'last used' date, and label those who engaged in July but not August vs.
those who engaged in July and August.

Once I have that, I should be able to evaluate features of that group vs
the currently active users (testing hypotheses 2 and 3).

I can also look at last active date vs. account creation to test
hypothesis 1.

I'll focus on looking for differences in categorical features, namely
country, language, device, or company.

I also like that this table has the 'user\_id' feature, which will be
useful for joining on the previous \emph{emails} and \emph{users}
tables.

I'm not sure how to use a rollup table. If there's time, I'd should ask
someone how to implement it.

It looks like the engagement label in the 'event\_type' column is what I
need.

First, let's try to replicate the Section \ref{problem}.

Rationale: I want to get the count of \emph{weekly unique users} who
engaged with the product that week, ***If I can replicate the initial
finding then I know I'm on the right track.

OK, managed to reproduce the plot. Now I know where that data came from.

The dates should be formatted, but worry about pretty later.

Now, I'd like to drill down on the specific time range where users

\section{From the monthly summary I see 263 less users engaged in August
compared to
July.}\label{from-the-monthly-summary-i-see-263-less-users-engaged-in-august-compared-to-july.}

I'd like to label the users that stopped engaging between July and
August. \#\#\#\# This can be done using a SQL CASE statement.

Specifically, I want label user\_id's that were active in July, BUT NOT
active in August. Those will be my 'stopped' group. For comparison, I'll
label the user\_id's that were active in July, AND active in August.
Those will be my 'engaged' group.

Then, I can do some comparisons to see what's distinct about the stopped
group vs the engaged users.

263 - the earlier unique monthly count via SQL.

This chart is a little confusing- it looks like the 'engaged' got more
emails than the 'stopped'. That might be true, but that's because the
engaged group, as I've defined it, acquired additional unique users
through August. That agrees with differences I saw in monthly unique
users vs July AND August unique users.

\section{The take away here is that the 'stopped' group didn't see a
drop in email
deliveries.}\label{the-take-away-here-is-that-the-stopped-group-didnt-see-a-drop-in-email-deliveries.}

There isn't any indication to suggest this is a technical malfunction on
the delivery side.

\chapter{Clickthrough}\label{clickthrough}

I think this is more of a product of how I picked my groups rather than
being causal. Still, that's nice to see my SQL commands worked as
expected.

I think the story might go like this:

\textbf{\emph{Users in the 'stopped' group are still receiving emails as
expected, but they are not opening them compared to the 'engaged'
group.}}

\textbf{\emph{And if they do open them they aren't clicking through to
the platform.}}

\chapter{This answers WHAT is happening, but not the WHO or
WHY.}\label{this-answers-what-is-happening-but-not-the-who-or-why.}

\section{Who are they, where are they, and what are they using to
engage?}\label{who-are-they-where-are-they-and-what-are-they-using-to-engage}

I'll answer those next.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Section \ref{toc}}{}}\label{back-to-table-of-contents}

 \# User Profile - Engagement comparison by Location, Device, and
Company

I have an idea of what's happening, but I don't know why. To answer
this, I'll need to explore some of the other user-related features
available.

Awesome, from here I can test my hypotheses 2 and 3 to get an idea of
what distinguishes the users who stopped.

My initial thoughts are to explore location and device.

To me, it looks like a lot of people in the northern hemisphere stopped
engaging.

\chapter{US, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico stand out, but there's
others
too.}\label{us-canada-france-germany-mexico-stand-out-but-theres-others-too.}

It would be summer time in those countries. Maybe they went on vacation?

Let's check the device breakdown. Maybe it's a technical issue (app
update, website crash, etc).

\section{I don't see a large difference by device between stopped and
engaged
users.}\label{i-dont-see-a-large-difference-by-device-between-stopped-and-engaged-users.}

\subsection{This suggests to me there's not a technical issue with the
platforms (website, iphone app, android app,
etc).}\label{this-suggests-to-me-theres-not-a-technical-issue-with-the-platforms-website-iphone-app-android-app-etc.}

In general, there seems to a large number of macbook pro, macbook air,
and lenovo thinkpad users who stopped engaging. There's also a drop in
iphone and galaxy s4 users.

Those are more modern devices... I want to test whether this drop in
engagement is specific to a single or group of companies.

It's predominately English speakers who have stopped engaging, although
there's also a large proportion of french and spanish, and japanese.
This aligns with the country data seen earlier.

 \# To summarize: 1) a majority of the 'stopped' users are in northern
hemisphere countries. 2) the 'stopped' users aren't specific to any
specific device. 3) the 'stopped' users are receiving the weekly digest,
but they're not opening it.
